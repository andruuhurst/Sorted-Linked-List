# Sorted-Linked-List


A Generic Linked-List Object.

The list is always maintained in ascending order so as each item is added to (or
removed from) the list. Duplicate values are allowed in the list.

Unique Functions:

showList() : (no parameters or return value) that
will extract all of the values from the list and display them in order, one per line,
followed by another line displaying how many values are currently in the list. If the
list is empty, display the message “The list is currently empty” instead.

replace() : that takes in two parameters (the data object to
replaced, followed by the one to be inserted) that will remove the first occurrence of
the item to be replaced and add the second parameter to the list. The method
returns a boolean - true if the item to be replaced was found, false if not.

showList() with an integer parameter which represents how many
items to display on each line.

getMode() : Gets the Mode of all comparable data inside the list. this is implemented with
a custome interface
